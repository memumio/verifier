# MemumVerifier

Here is the open source Spigot plugin Memum.io uses to verify newly signed up users. It connects to the PostgreSQL database of Memum.io, and simply just sends out a random 6-digit code to the database as well as the UUID of the player signing up, to ensure that the individual signing up truly does have access to the Minecraft account they entered into Memum.
